    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Venus Cosmetics was born from a love of animals and an eagerness to inspire.
        Our mission is to create an educated community of health and beauty experts
        and to offer cruelty-free, effective, and pure products.
    </p> <br>
    <p>After years of experimenting with the best-of-the-best in beauty, we are
        still seeing a void in the industry for products that performed across all
        skin types and tones. Our team of aestheticians along with our founder, Chi Nguyen,
        decides to combat this issue. Together they focus on creating products that fits a wide
        range of traditionally hard-to-match skin tones, creating formulas that work for all skin
        types, and pinpointing universal shades so that everyone can express themselves through our brand.
        Our products are designed to feel lightweight, even as they deliver buildable
        coverage that effortlessly layers, to ultimately “make skin look like skin.”
