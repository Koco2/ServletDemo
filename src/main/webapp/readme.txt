Overview:

1. to make the column and row display under products I used PHP and MySQL to 
   retrieve the information and displayed it in the PHP file display_eyeproduct.php
2 &3. after clicking "Complete Order" you'll be sent to a checkout page
	I used the "prepare" statement in saveDB.php to execute the statements secirely
4. Using Ajax you can:

	1. Narrow down your search when inputing the state in the shipping form
	2. Automatically input state by putting in the zipcode
